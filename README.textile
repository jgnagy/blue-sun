h1. *{color:#00e}Blue Sun* info

h2. Introduction

*{color:#00e}Blue Sun* is attempt at a feature rich BitTorrent tracker and index in a single Ruby on Rails application. It is still *very* new, and as such should not be used for anything critical.

The name *{color:#00e}Blue Sun* is inspired by the show "Firefly":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series) and The Blue Sun Corporation that knows (and is seemingly responsible) for all things bad in the 'verse. This application will be _tracking_ torrents and information about them, so it seemed like a good enough fit.

h2. Purpose

The purpose of *{color:#00e}Blue Sun* is to:

# Learn more about the BitTorrent protocol.
# Write (from what I can tell) the first public tracker written in Rails.
# Hopefully make a popular project for both public and private BitTorrent tracking.

With any luck, I'll eventually reach all these goals.

h2. Project Status

Current, *{color:#00e}Blue Sun* does *nothing* it's supposed to, since it is nothing more than a base Rails 3 project. I'll update this section as I do more work on the project.
